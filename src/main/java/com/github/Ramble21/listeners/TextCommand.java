If that becomes law, you can forgor \uD83D\uDC80 all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a W with the bros on Fort. Chat, is this prime minister serious? Even though he’s the prime minister of Australia, sometimes it feels like he’s the CEO of Ohio! I would be taking an L if I did not mention the ops, who want to cut WA’s Gyatts and Services tax. The decision voters will be making in a few months time will be between a mid government, a dogwater opposition, or a crossbench that will mog both of them!
